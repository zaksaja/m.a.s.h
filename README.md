# m.a.s.h

Throughout the process of editing this project I drew inspiration from my last one, utilizing the element of chance to my benefit. Primarily I wanted to work on a project that takes the nostalgic elements of childhood when playing M.A.S.H and implement them into a more aesthetically pleasing and more mature setting - even though the point remains a bit silly and light hearted. 

For the overall look I wanted to go simplistic but effective and really make the 'fill in the blank' elements stand out to the audience. I started off with simply three elements and soonafter added 7 more. Following the life path of someone and getting to know what they enjoy and where they believe they are at in life has always been fascinating to me - I truly enjoy listening to people and what goes on in their little worlds. This website is meant both as an 'assessment' of one's aspirations in life but rather it's mostly a fun poke at an old game pulled into a new format. 

Goals I acheived:
1. Made a commentary on indviduals aspirations in a chance based system.
2. Kept a simplistic but pleasing design - transformed a kitchy and childish idea into something more 'classy'.
3. Maintained an element of surprise and added some more interesting descriptions than I'd used before; more indepth and fuller commentary.
